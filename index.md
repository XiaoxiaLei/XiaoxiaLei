<p>I am currently a 4th year PhD student in the Department of Information, Technology and Innovation at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University</p>

<!-- , My research aims to develop novel machine learning algorithms for data-driven decision making practices, with focus on bandits and multitask learning. In addition, I also seek to provide safe and robust machine learning solutions. My work has been motivated by real-world business applications in healthcare operations, textual analytics, and dynamic pricing. </p>
 
<!-- advised by <a href="https://hamsabastani.github.io"> Hamsa Bastani</a>. I will join <a href="https://wpcarey.asu.edu/">Arizona State University W. P. Carey School of Business</a> as an Instructor in Fall 2023 and an Assistant Professor of Information Systems from Fall 2024.  Previously, I graduated from Tsinghua University with a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.A. in Economics, and the University of Chicago with a M.S. in Statistics. </p> -->

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
